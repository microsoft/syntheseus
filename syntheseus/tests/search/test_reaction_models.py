Test reaction models.

Note that some testing is done implicitly in the algorithm tests
(i.e. those tests will only pass if the reaction models are working properly).
Therefore the tests here are not super exhaustive: instead they try to explicitly
look for some behaviours which might be overlooked by the algorithm tests.
