Syntheseus is a package for end-to-end retrosynthetic planning.
- ‚öíÔ∏è Combines search algorithms and reaction models in a standardized way
- üß≠ Includes implementations of common search algorithms
- üß™ Includes wrappers for state-of-the-art reaction models
- ‚öôÔ∏è Exposes a simple API to plug in custom models and algorithms
- üìà Can be used to benchmark components of a retrosynthesis pipeline

## Setup

We support two installation modes:
- *core installation* allows you to build and benchmark your own models or search algorithms
- *full installation* additionally allows you to perform end-to-end search using some of the supported models

For core installation (minimal dependencies, no ML libraries) run

```bash
# Create and activate a new conda environment (or use your own).
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate syntheseus

pip install -e .
```

For full installation (including all supported models and dependencies for visualization/development) run

```bash
conda env create -f environment_full.yml
conda activate syntheseus-full

pip install -e ".[all]"
```

Both sets of instructions above assume you already cloned the repository via

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/syntheseus.git
cd syntheseus
```

Note that `environment_full.yml` pins the CUDA version (to 11.3) for reproducibility.
If you want to use a different one, make sure to edit the environment file accordingly.

Additionally, we also support GLN, but that requires a specialized environment and is thus not installed via `pip`. See [here](syntheseus/reaction_prediction/environment_gln/) for a Docker environment necessary for running GLN.

### Reducing the number of dependencies

To keep the environment smaller, you can replace the `all` option with a comma-separated subset of `{chemformer,local-retro,megan,mhn-react,retro-knn,root-aligned,viz,dev}` (`viz` and `dev` correspond to visuzalisation and development dependencies, respectively).
For example, `pip install -e ".[local-retro,root-aligned]"` installs only LocalRetro and RootAligned.
If installing a subset of models, you can also delete the lines in `environment_full.yml` marked with names of models you do not wish to use.

Syntheseus contains two subpackages: `reaction_prediction`, which deals with benchmarking single-step reaction models, and `search`, which can use any single-step model to perform multi-step search.
Each is designed to have minimal dependencies, allowing it to run in a wide range of environments.
While specific components (single-step models, policies, or value functions) can make use of Deep Learning libraries, the core of `syntheseus` does not depend on any.

If you only want to use either of the two subpackages, you can limit the dependencies further by installing the dependencies separately and then running

```bash
pip install -e .  --no-dependencies
```

See `pyproject.toml` for a list of dependencies tied to each subpackage.

### Model checkpoints

See table below for links to model checkpoints trained on USPTO-50K alongside with information on how these checkpoints were obtained.
Note that all checkpoints were produced in a way that involved external model repositories, hence may be affected by the exact license each model was released with.
For more details about a particular model see the top of the corresponding model wrapper file in `reaction_prediction/inference/`.


| Model checkpoint link                                          | Source |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| [Chemformer](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42009888)  | finetuned by us starting from checkpoint released by authors |
| [GLN](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42012720)         | released by authors |
| [LocalRetro](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42012729)  | trained by us |
| [MEGAN](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42012732)       | trained by us |
| [MHNreact](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42012777)    | trained by us |
| [RetroKNN](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42012786)    | trained by us |
| [RootAligned](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42012792) | released by authors |

In `reaction_prediction/cli/eval.py` a forward model can be used for computing back-translation (round-trip) accuracy.
See [here](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42012708) for a Chemformer checkpoint finetuned for forward prediction on USPTO-50K. As for the backward direction, pretrained weights released by original authors were used as a starting point.


## Development

Syntheseus is currently under active development.
If you want to help us develop syntheseus please install and run `pre-commit`
checks before committing code.

We use `pytest` for testing. Please make sure tests pass on your branch before
submitting a PR (and try to maintain high test coverage).

```bash
python -m pytest --cov syntheseus/tests
```
