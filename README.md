Syntheseus is a package for end-to-end retrosynthetic planning.
- ‚öíÔ∏è Combines search algorithms and reaction models in a standardized way
- üß≠ Includes implementations of common search algorithms
- üß™ Includes wrappers for state-of-the-art reaction models
- ‚öôÔ∏è Exposes a simple API to plug in custom models and algorithms
- üìà Can be used to benchmark components of a retrosynthesis pipeline

## Setup

We support two installation modes:
- *core installation* not tied to a specific reaction model allows you to build and benchmark your own models or search algorithms
- *full installation* backed by one of the supported models allows you to perform end-to-end retrosynthetic search

For full installation we currently support the following reaction models: Chemformer, LocalRetro, MEGAN, MHNreact, RetroKNN and RootAligned SMILES; see [here](syntheseus/reaction_prediction/environments/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

For core installation simply run

```bash
# Clone and cd into the repository.
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/syntheseus.git
cd syntheseus

# Create and activate a new conda environment (or use your own).
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate syntheseus

# Install into the current environment.
pip install -e .
```

Syntheseus contains two subpackages: `reaction_prediction`, which deals with benchmarking single-step reaction models, and `search`, which can use any single-step model to perform multi-step search.
Each is designed to have minimal dependencies, allowing it to run in a wide range of environments.
While specific components (single-step models, policies, or value functions) can make use of Deep Learning libraries, the core of `syntheseus` does not depend on any.

If you only want to use either of the two subpackages, you can limit the dependencies further by installing the dependencies separately and then running

```bash
pip install -e .  --no-dependencies
```

See `pyproject.toml` for a list of dependencies tied to each subpackage.

## Development

Syntheseus is currently under active development and does not have a fixed API
(but we will fix it very soon).
If you want to help us develop syntheseus please install and run `pre-commit`
checks before committing code.

We use `pytest` for testing. Please make sure tests pass on your branch before
submitting a PR (and try to maintain high test coverage).

```bash
python -m pytest --cov syntheseus/tests
```
